Syntax:
    if e1 then e2 else e3
    where if, the, and else are keywords and
    e1, e2, and e3 are subexpressions

Type-checking:
    first e1 must have type bool
    e2 and e3 can have any type, but they must have the same type t
    the type of the entire expression is also t

Evaluation rules:
    first evaluate e1 to value called v1
    if it's true, evaluate e2 and that result is the whole expression's result
    else, evaluate e3 and that result is the whoel expressions' result
