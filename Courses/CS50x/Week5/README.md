* [Inheritance](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/5/): Complete the implementation of inheritance.c, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. The oldest generation will have alleles assigned randomly to them.
* [Speller](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/5/speller/): Implement, in order, load, hash, size, check, and unload as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that TIME IN load, TIME IN check, TIME IN size, and TIME IN unload are all minimized.
